- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvoCodeLab
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with Visual Studio Code (VSC) and I am in the begining stages of understanding the basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects to help my learning journey
- 📫 How to reach me ... for the time being, let's keep it on this platform
- 😄 Pronouns: ... let's not define ourselves jsut yet
- ⚡ Fun fact: This is my second time learning to code. First was C++ which I have not used in a very long time, so most of it has been forgotten
